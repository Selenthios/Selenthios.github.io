Hey! 

This is a pretty (very) late post. So I need to say sorry about that.

But I have great news! I have been hired! I don't want to give out names, and what not, at this very moment. But they seem like an awesome company and I'll be able to finally get into my dream job.

Did some work on my car this weekend and took lots of vitamin c (I do not want to miss any of my first week). I know some usually dread working in an office coding like this. But I am very excited! Being able to do something like this for the forseeable future is very reassuring. I have done nothing but labor work since I started working, period. An opportunity like this is welcome. 

I will, hopefully, continue to edit and post new things on here.

Also a quick update.. My personal blog is very close to done! I am also continuing to do my workouts. Remember..Hard work always pays off. You should never be unhappy with where you are.

Well first day of work at my awesome new job coming up..

Let's go!!
