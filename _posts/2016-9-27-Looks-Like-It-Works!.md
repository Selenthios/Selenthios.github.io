# We are on Our Way!

Well check that out! Looks like I got it to work. 


So here is the game plan. I am hoping to continue updating my portfolio, tell all of you about my coding journey, 
and figure this all out. I am hoping to update and post a new blog at least once a week. But while I start I am going to probably
post a little more frequently than that. 


A little about me to start this all off. I grew up in Oregon most of my life and decided to move to Missouri at the age of 20. I 
went to college at Clackamas Community for Web Design and Development. I received my certificate in early 2015 and moved to Missouri
January 2nd. Ever since then ( and even before) I have been practicing coding techniques and learning non-stop. Why have I not posted, used Github, 
or decided to make something for others till recently? Well, I never felt like I was good enough. Like I could compete 
with others. Turns out I was wrong! 

Time to conquer the world of code...

One line at a time!
