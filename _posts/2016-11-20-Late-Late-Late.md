title: "Late, Late, Late"

This one is also very late. But starting a new job really threw a wrench in the schedule. 

I absolutely love it though! The work is awesome, the people are fun, and it is exactly what I dreamt of doing!

I continue to do my coding practice. But am hoping to get a smidge of sidework (blog writing, etc.) after work. Just so I can start dabbling in small stock apps. I'd like to get more into such things as time goes on.

This blog post will be a little shorter. But I will try to get something written once a week.
