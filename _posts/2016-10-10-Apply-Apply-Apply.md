title: "Apply, Apply, Apply"

I have been constantly applying for positions I feel I am fit for and still very excited about all this.

This week I dipped into Wordpress and have been working on a couple personal websites. I also ordered some pretty rad business cards
for freelance stuff and hope to be spreading them around when they arrive.

Whether it be applying for jobs, applying yourself to relevant stuff, or applying what you have learned. Constantly staying busy is 
key. I would love a job in this field. But honestly, I find all of this fascinating and fun with or without pay. I have thought that way for a long time
but until recently I never really applied what I learned and did not create anything exciting.

That all changed recently when I did some work in a graphic design/web business. It looked like something I could legitimately do 
every day for the rest of my career. It is why I went to college and why I continue to better myself and my work.
