title: "Journey Through Javascript"
---

I have been going through only Javascript in Enki for the last month and I have to say..There is a lot to learn.

Getting through Eloquent JS and Enki practices has been quite the task, but is a very rewarding one! There is so much to it all.
Which someone (anyone really) in my position should constantly be staying up to date with. 

On a related tech note, I have also been looking through the documentation in Angular 2 (in hopes of starting up an app idea here soon).
It would also be pretty beneficial just for general learning and coding.

One a completely seperate note... I am kind of tempted to make a seperate blog just about everyday life. If anything, it would vastly
improve my writing skills and be a place for me to talk about things not tech related.. Right now I feel as if I am just typing thoughts
out here for me to read later. Which is perfectly fine. I never planned for a lot of people to ever read this blog.

So I think I might just do that. Start up a casual blog. Let's see what happens!


Thanks for stopping by!
