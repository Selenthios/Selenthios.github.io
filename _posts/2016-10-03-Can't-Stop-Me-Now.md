# Learning... A lot of things!

So I was able to do some pretty neat updates and Javascript tricks. I have been religiously doing the Enki workouts 
and reading Eloquent JS. I can't tell you how excited I am about all of this. Coding every day and figuring out more and
more. 

Up next will be styling this blog some more and adding a few more sites to my portfolio.


This is fun! I used to have to look quite a bit up when my girlfriend had a question about something or when it was all coming
back to me. But now I can just start typing away and know exactly what I am doing. Feels good.


On a seperate note... I think it would be a good idea to revive my twitter. For a couple of reasons.

1) Being able to follow some of the top guys in the industry is a must

2) Helps me keep up to date with everything

3) Good way to get my name out there and start asking questions/learn.


I'll make sure to keep you updated! So far so good!
