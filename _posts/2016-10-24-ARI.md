title: "Angular, React, and Ionic"
---


This weekend I did quite a bit of research into Angular, React, and Ionic.

I have been pondering making an app using Ionic. Simply for my personal use and just some experience. Ionic seems to just be a layer on top of Angular. I think I will try it out that way and see hwow it goes. Blog posts will hopefully be popping up on the progress of that and my personal blog.

I also have been studying React.js a little more after I got a request for an interview. I know quite a bit about Javascript now. But I still have a long ways to go to learn all of the frameworks, etc.

On the subject of my personal blog that we talked about last week, I discovered a way to branch Jekyll and will see if I can go off of that. Would make things a lot easier and I really like the use of Markdown for blogging.


My blog posts also jump around quite a bit from subject to subject.. Better work on that!
